# hello-world
This is the first repository I've ever created! It is sick nasty, bro.

My name is Michael Beiley, and I'm a 2nd year computer science major at the University of Arizona. #beardown
I am creating this github account in hopes of immersing myself in all things coding. Currently, I have beginner-level
experience with Java, HTML, and CSS. Along with novice-level experience with Javascript, PHP, MYSQL, JSON, and AJAX.
I'm excited to further my expertise in these langauges, and acquire new skills as I move forward.
